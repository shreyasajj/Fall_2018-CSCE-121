The Bull and Cows work on the premis of finding stuff in arrays. It splits up the input and check for incorrect values. Finally it checks if the values are in the intial version.
If they are, it check for if its in the right place. If it is bull otherwise cow. When 5 bulls are reach it finishes the game and show the count.
